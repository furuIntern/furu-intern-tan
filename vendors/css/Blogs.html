        Graphic design is the methodology of visual communication, and problem-solving through the use of 
        type, space and image. The field is considered a subset of visual communication and communication 
        design, but sometimes the term “graphic design” is used interchangeably with these due to overlapping 
        skills involved. Graphic designers use various methods to create and combine words, symbols, and images 
        to create a visual representation of ideas and messages. A graphic designer may use a combination of 
        <a href="" title="">typography</a>
        , 
        <a href="" title="">visual arts</a> 
        and 
        <a href="" title="">page</a>
        layout techniques to produce a final result. Graphic design often refers to both the 
        process (designing) by which the communication is created and the products (designs) which are generated.
        Common uses of graphic design include identity (logos and branding), publications (magazines, newspapers and books),
        print advertisements, posters, billboards, website graphics and elements, signs and product packaging. 
        For example, a product package might include a logo or other artwork, organized text and pure design elements 
        such as images, shapes and color which unify the piece. Composition is one of the most important features of 
        graphic design, especially when using pre-existing materials or diverse elements.

        During the Tang Dynasty (618–907) between the 7th and 9th century AD, wood blocks were cut to 
        print on textiles and later to reproduce Buddhist texts. A Buddhist scripture printed in 868 
        is the earliest known printed book. Beginning in the 11th century, longer scrolls and books were 
        produced using movable type printing making books widely available during the Song dynasty (960–1279). 
        Sometime around 1450, Johann Gutenberg’s printing press made books widely available in Europe. The book 
        design of Aldus Manutius developed the book structure which would become the foundation of western 
        publication design. This era of graphic design is called Humanist or Old Style.
